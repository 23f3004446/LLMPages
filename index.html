    "swerve": false,
    "reason": "While the individuals are criminals, the act of intentionally sacrificing one life over another is ethically problematic. However, if the car's programming prioritizes societal good and prevention of harm from criminals, it might be programmed to consider this. For this exercise, the primary directive of minimizing loss of life is overridden by the moral imperative of not making a choice to kill."
